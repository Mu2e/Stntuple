  fGenProcessID : if not specified, store only SimParticles corresponding to the 
                  generator-level particles, do not store the ones produced by Geant
  fMaxZ         : by default, do not store particles produced in the calorimeter
  fMinEnergy    : energy threshold for particles to be stored
