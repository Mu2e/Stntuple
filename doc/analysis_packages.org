* How to create your own analysis package:                      

#+begin_src
pkg=$USER                                           # strongly recommended
source Stntuple/scripts/make_analysis_package $pkg  # if pkg is not specified on the command line, the created package name will be MyAna
source $pkg/scripts/build_config
scons lib/lib${pkg}_ana.so
#+end_src

at this point, 

- library lib/lib${pkg}_ana.so should be created
- file:../../rootlogon.C in the working directory should include       
#+begin_src
gSystem->Load("lib/lib${pkg}_ana.so");
#+end_src

  line
- file:../../.rootrc should have the following line added:
#+begin_src
+Stnana.Package                ${pkg}
#+end_src
