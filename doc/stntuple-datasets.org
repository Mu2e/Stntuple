* _STNTUPLE datasets_                                                        

  - Mu2e STNTUPLE dataset are kept on BLUEARC disks and in dCache. The datasets are cataloged and could be accessed 
  via the catalog. The top level catalog page is here: https://mu2e.fnal.gov/public/hep/computing/Stntuple/cafdfc/

  - Logically, all datasets are split into books (think - cataloged folders), 
  such that two users using two different books, could have two datasets with the same name. 
  The books could be public and private. Datasets in public books are centrally maintained by the collaboration,
  private books are the books maintained by individual users and serve their own needs.
  The only difference between them is that one can't complain if a dataset, cataloged in the private book 
  of another user, disappears - public datasets belong to public books. 

  - If you want to create your own book, send email to murat@fnal.gov to use cataloged datasets, 
  describe the catalog location in your .rootrc file:
