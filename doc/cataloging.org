* How to catalog a STNTUPLE dataset                                          

  Catalog of a STNTUPLE dataset is created by the [[file:../scripts/catalog_stntuples][Stntuple/scripts/catalog_stntuples]] script, see its source for instructions

** Call format:                                                              

#+begin_src
Stntuple/scripts/catalog_stntuples -b book -d dataset -m mode -v verbose -u user -h host -D directory -p pattern  
Parameters:

-D directory: directory with the STNTUPLE files to catalog
-p pattern  : pattern, grepping on which one can create a list of files
-d dataset  : dataset ID (name)
-b book     : datasets could be associated with several books, for example, personal user books: book=gianipez or book=murat
-h host     : if datasets are stored on a remote host
-u user     : user name on a remote host to login
-i          : install catalog into the web area (Stntuple.Catalog in .rootrc)

** Cataloging steps:                                                         

- move fileset and file catalogs to /web/sites/mu2e.fnal.gov/htdocs/atwork/computing/Stnuple/cafdfc/$BOOK, 
  $BOOK here stands for your book, (coordinate with murat@fnal.gov and gianipez@pi.infn.it)

- NOTE: /web/sites/mu2e.fnal.gov/htdocs/atwork/computing/Stnuple/cafdfc is not accessible from mu2ebuild01. 
  you need to be a member of a special UNIX group to write to that area (ask Ray)

- update the html book catalog and make the new dataset visible for everybody 
  by running [[file:../scripts/update_book_catalog][Stntuple/scripts/update_book_catalog]] :

#+begin_src
 Stntuple/scripts/update_book_catalog $BOOK
#+end_src

one can also use his private web area to catalog a dataset, private user web areas are located at 
#+begin_src
/publicweb/`echo $USER | cut -b 1`/$USER, 
#+end_src
for example, /publicweb/m/murat

- if $BOOK/AAA_DESCRIPTION.html file exists, its contents is included into the book catalog

- if you introduce a new dataset version (vvvV, described at Stntuple-Dataset-Naming-Conventions), 
  add file $BOOK/AAA_DESCRIPTION.vvvV.html with brief description of the version specifics.

Use files in /web/sites/mu2e.fnal.gov/htdocs/atwork/computing/Stnuple/cafdfc/mdc2018 as templates

** Notes on the catalog file format:                                         

#+begin_src
Lines starting from '#' are comment lines. Exceptions ?? metadata lines (keys are 'NTOTAL:' and such, no space between 'NTOTAL' and ':')
 '# NTOTAL: xxxxx'       : defines total number of events on disk 
 '# NGENERATED: xxxx'    : defines total number of generated events (>= NTOTAL because of filtering) 
 '# SIGNAL_PARTICLE: xx' : PDG code of the 'signal' particle, i.e. 11  
 '# GENERATOR_CODE: xx'  : generator code 
 '# DESCRIPTION: ??..'    : one-line description of the dataset,  Stntuple/scripts/update_book_catalog includes the description line into the book catalog
#+end_src

If a AAA_DESCRIPTION.html file exists in the dataset catalog directory, a link to it will be included into the html directory 
of the book. This allows to have a more detailed description of the dataset available on the web.  The metadata may or may not 
be present, currently no software tools rely on the metadata presence.
